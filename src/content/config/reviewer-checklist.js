### Reviewer checklist
- [ ] I can answer the following questions:
   - [ ] What impact will this have on the rest of the system? 
   - [ ] Where are the blind spots, if any? 
   - [ ] Do these changes solve the problem described? 
- [ ] Are these changes up to our code quality standards?
   - [ ] Is there a way to prevent confusion in the future with comments or clearer language?
   - [ ] Did I highlight where I struggled to understand what the code was saying?
   - [ ] Did I highlight instances where I've seen patterns work or fail to work?
- [ ] Did I highlight areas I learned something?
- [ ] Do I agree that if something breaks, I co-signed these changes and thought they were a good idea when we merged it?
